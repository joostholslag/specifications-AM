= The Assertion Package

== Overview

Assertions are expressed in archetypes in typed first-order predicate logic (FOL). They are used in two places: to express archetype slot constraints, and to express rules in complex object constraints. In both of these places, their role is to constrain something _inside_ the archetype. Constraints on external resources such as terminologies are expressed in the constraint binding part of the archetype `ontology`, described in Figure <<terminology_package>>. The `assertion` package is illustrated below.

== Semantics

Archetype assertions are statements which contain the following elements:

* variables, which are inbuilt, archetype path-based, or external query results;
* manifest constants of any primitive type, including the date/time types
* arithmetic operators: `+`, `*`, `-`, `/`, `^` (exponent), `%` (modulo division)
* relational operators: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `\<=`, `=`, `!=`, `matches`
* boolean operators: `not`, `and`, `or`, `xor`
* quantifiers applied to container variables: `for_all`, `exists`

The written syntax of assertions is defined in the openEHR ADL document. The package described here is currently designed to allow the representation of a general-purpose binary expression tree, as would be generated by a parser. This may be replaced in the future by a more specific model, if needed.

This relatively simple model of expressions is sufficiently powerful for representing FOL expressions on archetype structures, although it could clearly be more heavily subtyped.
