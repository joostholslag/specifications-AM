= Preface

== Purpose

This document contains the definitive statement of archetype semantics, in the form of an object model for archetypes. The model presented here can be used as a basis for building software that processes archetypes, independent of their persistent representation; equally, it can be used to develop the output side of parsers that process archetypes in a linguistic format, such as the {openehr_am_adl14}[openEHR Archetype Definition Language (ADL)^], XML-instance and so on. As a specification, it can be treated as an API for archetypes.

It is recommended that the {openehr_am_adl14}[openEHR ADL document^] be read in conjunction with this document, since it contains a detailed explanation of the semantics of archetypes, and many of the examples are more obvious in ADL, regardless of whether ADL is actually used with the object model presented here or not.

== Nomenclature

In this document, the term 'attribute' denotes any stored property of a type defined in an object model, including primitive attributes and any kind of relationship such as an association or aggregation. XML 'attributes' are always referred to explicitly as 'XML attributes'.

== Status

This specification is in the {spec_status} state. The development version of this document can be found at {openehr_am_aom14}[{openehr_am_aom14}^].

Known omissions or questions are indicated in the text with a 'to be determined' paragraph, as follows:

*TBD*: (example To Be Determined paragraph)

NOTE: this specification is a re-formatted issue of the {openehr_am_aom14_pdf}[original AOM 1.4 Specification from openEHR Release 1.0.2^]. There are slight changes in formatting, citations and other references, corrections to typographical errors and changed syntax colourisation due to the use of more modern language-based syntax colourisers in the publishing tools.

NOTE: for users requiring the most recent form of ADL and archteype technology in general, the {openehr_am_aom2}[Archetype Definition Language 2 (ADL2) specifications should be used^]. In particular, the {openehr_am_overview}[Archetype Technology Overview^] should be referred to for the most current state of Archetype Technology.

== Feedback

Feedback may be provided on the {openehr_adl_forum}[openEHR ADL forum^].

Issues may be raised on the {component_prs}[specifications Problem Report tracker^].

To see changes made due to previously reported issues, see the {component_history}[{component} component Change Request tracker^].

== Conformance

Conformance of a data or software artifact to an openEHR specification is determined by a formal test of that artifact against the relevant {openehr_its_component}[openEHR Implementation Technology Specification(s) (ITSs)^], such as an IDL interface or an XML-schema. Since ITSs are formal derivations from underlying models, ITS conformance indicates model conformance.

== Background

=== What is an Archetype?

Archetypes are constraint-based models of domain entities, or what some might call "structured business rules". Each archetype describes configurations of data instances whose classes are described in a reference model; the instance configurations are considered to be valid exemplars of a particular domain concept. Thus, in medicine, an archetype might be designed to constrain configurations of instances of a simple node/arc information model, that express a "microbiology test result" or a "physical examination". Archetypes can be composed, specialised, and templated for local use. The archetype concept has been described in detail by Beale <<Beale_2000>>, <<Beale_2002>>. Most of the detailed formal semantics are described in the {openehr_am_adl14}[openEHR Archetype Definition Language^]. The openEHR archetype framework is described in the {openehr_am_overview}[openEHR Archetypes Technical Overview^].

=== Context

The object model described in this document relates to linguistic forms of archetypes as shown in the figure below. The model (upper right in the figure) is the object-oriented semantic equivalent of the ADL the Archetype Definition Language BNF language definition, and, by extension, any formal transformation of it. Instances of the model (lower right on the figure) are themselves archetypes, and correspond one-to-one with archetype documents expressed in ADL or a related language.

== Tools

Various tools exist for creating and processing archetypes. The {openehr_awb}[ADL Workbench^] is a reference compiler, visualiser and editor. The openEHR tools can be {modelling_tools}[downloaded from the website^] .
Source projects can be found at the {openehr_git}[openEHR Github project^].

== Changes from Previous Versions

=== Version 0.6 to 2.0

As part of the changes carried out to ADL version 1.3, the archetype object model specified here is revised, also to version 2.0, to indicate that ADL and the AOM can be regarded as 100% synchronised specifications.

* added a new attribute `_adl_version_ : String` to the `ARCHETYPE` class;
* changed name of `ARCHETYPE._concept_code_` attribute to `_concept_`.
