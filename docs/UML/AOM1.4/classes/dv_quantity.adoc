h|*Class*
2+^h|*DV_QUANTITY*

h|*Description*
2+a|Quantitified type representing  scientific  quantities, i.e. quantities expressed as a magnitude and units.  Units were inspired by the Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM), developed by Gunther Schadow and Clement J. McDonald of The Regenstrief Institute.

Can also be used for time durations, where it is more convenient to treat these as simply a number of seconds rather than days, months, years.

h|*Attributes*
^h|*Signature*
^h|*Meaning*

h|*1..1*
|*magnitude*: `Real`
a|Numeric magnitude of the quantity.

h|*0..1*
|*precision*: `Integer`
a|Precision to which the value of the quantity is expressed, in terms of number of decimal places. The value 0 implies an integral quantity.
The value -1 implies no limit, i.e. any number of decimal places.

h|*1..1*
|*units*: `String`
a|Stringified units, expressed in UCUM unit syntax, e.g. "kg/m2", â€œmm[Hg]", "ms-1", "km/h". Implemented accordingly in subtypes.

h|*0..1 +
(redefined)*
|*normal_range*: `DV_INTERVAL<DV_QUANTITY>`
a|Optional normal range.

h|*0..1 +
(redefined)*
|*other_reference_ranges*: `List<REFERENCE_RANGE<DV_QUANTITY>>`
a|Optional tagged other reference ranges for this value in its particular measurement context.

h|
|*is_integral* (): `Boolean`
a|True if precision = 0, meaning that the magnitude is a whole number.
