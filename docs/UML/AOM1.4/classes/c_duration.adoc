h|*Class*
2+^h|*C_DURATION*

h|*Description*
2+a|ISO 8601-compatible constraint on instances of Duration. In ISO 8601 terms, constraints might are of the form “PWD” (weeks and/or days), “PDTHMS” (days, hours, minutes, seconds) and so on. In official ISO 8601:2004, the ‘W’ (week) designator cannot be mixed in; allowing it is an openEHR-wide exception. Both range and the constraint pattern can be set at the same time, corresponding to the ADL constraint PWD/&#124;P0W..P50W&#124;.
