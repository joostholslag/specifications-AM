2+^h|*_P_C_ORDERED (abstract)_*

h|*Description*
2+a|Abstract parent of primitive constrainer classes based on ORDERED base types, i.e. types like Integer, Real, and the Date/Time types. The model constraint is a List of Intervals, which may include point Intervals, and acts as a efficient and formally tractable representation of any number of point values and/or contiguous intervals of an ordered value domain.

In its simplest form, the constraint accessor returns just a single point Interval<T> object, representing a single value.

The next simplest form is a single proper Interval <T> (i.e. normal two-sided or half-open interval). The most complex form is a list of any combination of point and proper intervals.
