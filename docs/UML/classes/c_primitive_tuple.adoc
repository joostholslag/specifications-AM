2+^h|*C_PRIMITIVE_TUPLE*

h|*Description*
2+a|Class representing a single object tuple instance in a tuple constraint. Each such instance is a vector of object constraints, where each member (each C_PRIMITIVE_OBJECT) corresponds to one of the C_ATTRIBUTEs referred to by the owning C_ATTRIBUTE_TUPLE.

|*c_conforms_to* ( +
other: `C_SECOND_ORDER[1]` +
): `Boolean`
a|True if constraints represented by this node, ignoring any sub-parts, are narrower or the same as other. Typically used during validation of specialised archetype nodes.

h|(effected)
|*c_congruent_to* ( +
other: `C_SECOND_ORDER[1]` +
): `Boolean`
a|True if constraints represented by this node contain no further redefinitions with respect to the node other. Typically used to test if an inherited node locally contains any constraints.
