h|*Class*
2+^h|*C_PRIMITIVE_TUPLE*

h|*Description*
2+a|Class representing a single object tuple instance in a tuple constraint. Each such instance is a vector of object constraints, where each member (each `C_PRIMITIVE_OBJECT`) corresponds to one of the `C_ATTRIBUTEs` referred to by the owning `C_ATTRIBUTE_TUPLE`.

a|True if constraints represented by this node, ignoring any sub-parts, are narrower or the same as other. Typically used during validation of specialised archetype nodes.
