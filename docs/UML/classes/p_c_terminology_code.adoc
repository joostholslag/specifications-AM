h|*Class*
2+^h|*P_C_TERMINOLOGY_CODE*

h|*Description*
2+a|Constrainer type for instances of TERMINOLOGY_CODE. The primary expression of the constraint is in the property `tuple_constraint', and comes in 3 variations:
* a single at-code
* a single ac-code, representing a value-set that is defined in the archetype terminology
* a list of at- and/or ac-codes, representing the possibilities of a tuple constraint
The last possibility above is enabled by the merge_tuple routine, which enables the constraint of another single-valued C_TERMINOLOGY_CODE to be merged with the current one.
