h|*Description*
2+a|Root object of an operational template. An operational template is derived from a TEMPLATE definition and the ARCHETYPEs and/or TEMPLATE_OVERLAYs mentioned by that template by a process of flattening, and potentially removal of unneeded languages and terminologies.

An operational template is used for generating and validating RM-canonical instance data, and also as a source artefact for generating other downstream technical artefacts, including XML schemas, APIs and UI form definitions.
