2+^h|*C_ATTRIBUTE_TUPLE*

h|*Description*
2+a|Object representing a constraint on an atttribute tuple, i.e. a group of attributes that are constrained together. Typically used for representing co-varying constraints like {units, range} constraints.

h|(effected)
|*c_conforms_to* ( +
other: `C_SECOND_ORDER[1]` +
): `Boolean`
a|True if constraints represented by this node, ignoring any sub-parts, are narrower or the same as other. Typically used during validation of specialised archetype nodes.

h|(effected)
|*c_congruent_to* ( +
other: `C_SECOND_ORDER[1]` +
): `Boolean`
a|True if constraints represented by this node contain no further redefinitions with respect to the node other. Typically used to test if an inherited node locally contains any constraints.
