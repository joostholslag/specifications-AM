h|*Class*
2+^h|*C_TIME*

h|*Description*
2+a|Constraint on instances of assumed primitive type Time in the form either of a set of validity values, or else date ranges based on the `C_ORDERED` list constraint. There is no validity flag for `_hour_`, since it must always be by definition mandatory in order to have a sensible time at all. Syntax expressions of instances of this class include `“HH:??:xx”` (time with optional minutes and seconds not allowed).

For a pattern constraint or no constraint, use an empty list.
