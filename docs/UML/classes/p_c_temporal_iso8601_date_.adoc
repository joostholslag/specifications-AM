h|*Class*
2+^h|*_P_C_TEMPORAL<ISO8601_DATE> (abstract)_*

h|*Description*
2+a|ISO 8601-compatible constraint on instances of Date in the form either of a set of
validity values, or an actual date range. There is no validity flag for  year', since it
must always be by definition mandatory in order to have a sensible date at all.
Syntax expressions of instances of this class include  YYYY-??-??  (date with
optional month and day).
Date ranges are probably only useful for historical dates.
