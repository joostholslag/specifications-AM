2+^h|*P_C_DATE*

h|*Description*
2+a|ISO 8601-compatible constraint on instances of Date in the form either of a set of validity values, or else date ranges based on the C_ORDERED list constraint. There is no validity flag for ‘year’, since it must always be by definition mandatory in order to have a sensible date at all. Syntax expressions of instances of this class include “YYYY-??-??” (date with optional month and day).
