= Syntax Specification

The normative specification of the ADL1.4 syntax is expressed in Antlr4 as a series of component grammars, shown below. This has been tested with the Antlr 4.9 implementation available from http://www.antlr.org[Antlr.org^]. The source files are available in two locations on Github - {openehr_adl_antlr}/tree/master/src/main/antlr/adl[adl-antlr repository^]. The ODIN grammar used in parts of an ADL archetype is not shown below, it can be found in the {openehr_odin}[openEHR ODIN specification^].

NOTE: this form of Antlr grammars is non-modal and mixed (i.e. parsers and lexers in same files). This will be changed in the next version to separated files and modal lexing, to deal better with ODIN embedded in ADL and related issues.

== ADL Outer Syntax

The following grammar expresses the outer syntax of ADL, i.e. the top-level structure of section keywords and initial identification lines in an ADL text.

--------
include::{openehr_adl_220_antlr_include}/adl/adl14.g4[]
--------

== cADL Syntax

The following grammar expresses the syntax of cADL composite types, i.e. the language of the `definition` section of an archetype.

[source, antlr-java]
--------
include::{openehr_adl_220_antlr_include}/adl/cadl14.g4[]
--------

== cADL Primitives Syntax

The following grammar defines the syntax of cADL primitives, which are used by cADL composites and also by ADL rules.

[source, antlr-java]
--------
include::{openehr_adl_220_antlr_include}/adl/cadl14_primitives.g4[]
--------

== Rules Syntax

The following grammar defines the syntax that may appear in the `rules` section of an archetype and also the assertions in Archetype slots.

[source, antlr-java]
--------
include::{openehr_adl_220_antlr_include}/adl/base_expressions.g4[]
--------

== ODIN structures

The following grammar defines the syntax for ODIN structures.

[source, antlr-java]
--------
include::{openehr_adl_220_antlr_include}/adl/odin.g4[]
--------

== ODIN value types

The following grammar defines the syntax for the terminal types in ADL, which are derived from ODIN.

[source, antlr-java]
--------
include::{openehr_adl_220_antlr_include}/adl/odin_values.g4[]
--------

== Base Lexer

The following grammar defines common lexical entities.

--------
include::{openehr_adl_220_antlr_include}/adl/base_lexer.g4[]
